- Center the page on mobile screens
- Replace any pixel units with relative units
- Create basic editor
- Add basic, horizontal progress bar
- Add fancier, circular progress bar around the time

## Basic Editor

Should show a form like:
- Name
An editable table with rows like
Time to speak, text to speak, text to show
1,"Get Ready", "Get Ready"
5,"Start deadbugs", "Start deadbugs (1 of 3)"
10,"Keep going!", "Keep going!"
20,"You got this!", "You got this!"
35,"Take a break", "Take a break (completed 1)"
45,"Start deadbugs", "Start deadbugs (2 of 3)"
50,"Keep going!", "Keep going!"
60,"You got this!", "You got this!"
75,"Take a break", "Take a break (completed 2)"
85,"Start deadbugs", "Start deadbugs (2 of 3)"
90,"Keep going!", "Keep going!"
100,"You got this!", "You got this!"
110,"All done, have a good day", "completed 3 of 3 deadbugs"

Ability to add / delete rows and save it
Validation to make sure time is always increasing
Validation to warn if text might not be said (next text to speak is too soon)
